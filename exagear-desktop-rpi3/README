# Descripton:
# ExaGear Desktop is a virtual machine that implements virtual x86 Linux 
# container on ARM and allows you to run Intel x86 applications directly on 
# ARM. For more information please see http://eltechs.com/product/exagear-desktop/ 
#
# On Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3 ExaGear supports hardware graphics 
# acceleration. This feature significantly increases performance of x86 
# applications that use OpenGL up to version 2.1.
#
# Configure hardware graphics acceleration on Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3:
# To to enable hardware graphics acceleration on the host system run the following 
# command from the command line terminal:
# $ sudo raspi-config
# You should see a blue screen with options in a gray box in the centre. Select 
# 'Update this tool to the latest version' and wait until the update is performed. 
# When blue screen with options will pop-up again select 'Advanced Options', then 
# select 'GL Driver' and then 'GL (Full KMS) OpenGL desktop driver with full KMS'. 
# When configuration is finished you will see the following message: 
# "Full KMS GL driver is enabled".
# Select <Ok> and then <Finish> and the raspi-config tool will ask you if you 
# would like to reboot. Select <Yes> to reboot the system and apply configuration 
# changes. 
#
# Installation:
# Run installation script in a directory with deb packages and one license key:
# $ sudo ./install-exagear.sh
# This script installs guest x86 image that better fits your host operating system.
# Sometimes you might need to install guest x86 Ubuntu image, for example Spotify 
# can run with the guest Ubuntu only. To force install the guest x86 Ubuntu run 
# installation script with following option:
# $ sudo ./install-exagear.sh ubuntu-1404
#
# Running:
# $ exagear
# Starting the shell in the guest image /opt/exagear/images/<guest_system_version>
# $ arch
# i686
#
# You are now inside the x86 world. You can use this guest shell as if it were 
# running on an x86 machine. Inside the guest session you can install Wine from 
# apt-get repositories:
# $ sudo apt-get install wine 
# To exit from the guest session use 'exit' command.
